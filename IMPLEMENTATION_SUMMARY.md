## 🗄️ Database Setup Required

**IMPORTANT**: You need to create the `waitlist` table in your Supabase database. 

Run this SQL in your Supabase SQL Editor:

\`\`\`sql
CREATE TABLE waitlist (
  id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  email TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE INDEX idx_waitlist_email ON waitlist(email);

ALTER TABLE waitlist ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

CREATE POLICY "Allow public inserts" ON waitlist
  FOR INSERT
  WITH CHECK (true);
\`\`\`

## 🔧 Configuration Details

**Supabase Project:**
- URL: https://ssflbgewaecdpqqltglm.supabase.co
- Using anon public key for client-side operations
- API route uses POST method to `/api/waitlist`

## 🎨 Design Features

- Modal design inspired by the provided screenshot
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Mobile-responsive
- Accessible (keyboard navigation, focus states)
- Error handling with user-friendly messages
- Loading states for better UX

## 🧪 Testing

To test the feature:
1. Open http://localhost:3000
2. Click "Join the Waitlist" button (with Apple icon)
3. Fill in Name and Email
4. Click "Join the Waitlist" to submit
5. Check Supabase database to verify the entry

## 📊 Data Flow

1. User clicks "Join the Waitlist" → Modal opens
2. User fills form and submits → Data sent to `/api/waitlist`
3. API validates data → Inserts into Supabase
4. Success → Show success message → Auto-close modal
5. Error → Show error message → User can retry

## 🔒 Security Features

- Email validation (regex pattern)
- Unique email constraint in database
- Row Level Security (RLS) enabled

2. Test the form submission
3. (Optional) Set up email notifications when someone joins
4. (Optional) Create an admin dashboard to view waitlist entries

## 💡 Future Enhancements

- Email confirmation/verification
- "Thank you" email after joining
- Admin dashboard to manage waitlist
- Export functionality for waitlist data
- Analytics tracking for conversion rates
- Social sharing options
